# Load the weekly Data

Dowload the weekly data and make available in the `tt` object.

```{r Load}
tt <- tt_load("2021-12-14")
```



# Glimpse Data

Take an initial look at the format of the data available.

```{r Glimpse}
tt %>% 
  map(glimpse) %>% 
  kableExtra::kbl()
```



```{r Wrangle}
lyrics <- tt$lyrics
lyrics_by_member <- lyrics %>% 
  separate_rows(section_artist, sep = ", | & | with | and ") %>%
  mutate(
    section_artist = str_remove_all(section_artist, "\\(|\\)|\\{|\\}")
  ) %>% 
  filter(section_artist %in% c("Sporty", "Baby", "Scary", "Ginger", "Posh"))
lyrics_by_member %>% 
  count(section_artist, sort = TRUE)
```


# Visualize

Using your processed dataset, create your unique visualization.

```{r Visualize}
